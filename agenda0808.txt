1. She is not ashamed.
I noticed last night was a lack of sarcasm.
Pops a bottle and says hero.
More than a thing and more than a some.
Please play.
I love it when the fountain turns colors.
Offerings of the banana.
Little bridges of the mean.
Better sayings can be held to the tongue.
I enjoy vinegar.
I like the smell of equality is rare, like my dad likes his steak.
Greet the yonder with the rare reactions.
Really?
I am not that kind of rebel.

4. 3 WRP
1. fascicular cambium (pg 642): botany cambium develops within the vascular bundle
2. pitch pine (pg 1338): an eastern North american (pinus rigada) pine tree that yields pitch or turpentine.
3. streptothricin (pg 1714): any of group of antibiotics produced by an actinomycete and active against various bacteria and viruses. Strepotomyces spectabilis (pertstotothricin)

That fascicular cambium is way better than that pitch pine shit that makes my medicine called olanzapine. It turns into turpentine. That means I have extra edge in my class action lawsuit against the drug because i felt high all the time and it could get the drug off the market. I will pursue my battles by great attempts of lathering streptothricin on the opponents pertstothricin. Get some more of that pertsothricin, its good for your feet.

Jambastanga is his new name.
What you know about name?
Its got beginning and the end.
Sometimes middle
If your long you do pretend
I am not that kind of rebel.

5. How is your flour.
How did it grow?
What do you see inside?
When you bake it with other ingredients?
I'm surrounded by the powder.
Your friction is what remades?
Purple is my flour.
I like to mix it well.
Orange is always welcome.
Lime is even more.

6.Olive oil sizzlemony
A kiss.
Lick each others cheeks.
Marceline on the keys
Strip to boxers.
Jump.
Do squats.
Tree pose.
Hold for 5 minutes.
Olive oil bottle is opened.
And then we pour the olive oil on the head.
Watch it drip down.

I'd give you another chance if you'd let me give you one.
