\
1.  Write the planar entities fabricated in new light.\
\
	The entities of planes are harnessed by culminated energy patterns that our whole world is engrossed with. The potential of every person is taken into account when generating a light plane and can last for millions of years with the footprint accounted for. The plane is only developed by high light energies that are sorted in sequences and vibrations like a puzzle. Every person has a certain amount of high frequency. Heightened frequency is a part of every person, and people have different levels of high frequency. It takes intellect and logic to be able to tap into these energies. It is simple for most people. These energies are in togetherness with the outer galaxies who drive us and inspire us to acquire a worldy synchronization of heightened energies to reach the new euphoria of the outer dimensions. The plane itself is often called another dimension, and this plane of energy, when powerful enough can bring the world to a new level of extraordinary proportions, and indefinitely take us away from the dark space that covers our world. The world would have an aura of sorts which would protect our atmosphere from escaping, and give our planet warmth. We would be suspended in the never ending day. \
\
2. Write a prediction for the planar alignments of the next week.\
\
	The planar alignments of this next week are within objection. We must object the general scope of sealed raises in towered energy that can be greetings amble in reasons to play instead of approach. Most people forget the approach. They just spit out a greeting. And most of all we stand on the fence that courages the greetings to be short and sweet instead of drawn out and exemplified. We are young should be the mantra of the next week. Antique entities have drawn us as crazy for speaking out our minds. Not to be stuck inside our heads reworking the answers, but instead nourishing ourselves with new ideas and adventures. It is not the week to reflect on the past. It is the week to energize our surroundings with works and endeavors and to breath in openness. You may be set back and off schedule if your fluctuations are peaking within the radiancy of yourself, instead of taking this focus and applying it to other people. \
\
3. 3 WRP  \
\
Roster, pg 1515, a list, especially of names. A list of the names of military officers and enlisted personnel enrolled in a particularly unit. \
Service tree, pg 1591, either of two meditteranean trees having clusters of white flowers, saw toothed toothed leaves and edible brownish fruit.\

\
The roster of different tamale treats was as long as the number of leaves that the service tree has.\
\
4. A letter, the rewordings of maturation.\
\
Maturing involves many emotions resolving themselves through recognition and sampling in an effort to exude attraction to your surroundings. People are in a constant state of maturation. Succeeding in maturing patterns involves many qualities to be defined as growing in nurturing worth of yourself and distinguishing the properties that are considered with expression that are in total what make up a personality. A lot can be assessed at the same time, and within the orders of maturation, the amount of things that the mind body and spirit can catch onto are involved in the practice of exerting ones self into consideration and drawing conclusions at the same time. \
\
There are many types of emotions. Apprehension towards them are allow for symmetry. Negative emotions detract from the body, release these with the assistance of indulging and pleasure. In the value of your maturation process will include the array of signals one sends or does not send to protect the significance of the bodies age. Essential markers are enter the claims of what the ego is set out for. Whether it be recognition, aim, decision making, or exerting qualities, the all have a consideration that can molded into the fuel to continue in a direction. Through identification of what the aim is, adaptation to the environment can initiate.  The claim is the best part of maturation. This is the after thought for most people, and can be what heightens an endeavor or feeling of accomplishment and order. Many become trouble makers, many become actors, and the sum of the seed when nourished correctly can infuse desire and act as a lubricant to what interaction has to be as a value to apprehend instead of detract. \
\
I have grown into someone who has no delay, at my young age of 24. I've always been like this, but I would say that the arena has always been on my mind, and in my maturation i would say keeping things small is what will be more humbling in the future. But then again, I am a Texan, and my desire to spread my life as literature is wide and vast, and gives me a feeling of accomplishment when I get feedback. It is ample to be seeing the array of differences between people, because the majority see the similarities. The weight of the fusing the considerations are not embarked unless the point of view is of quality instead of quantity. Perhaps I will use my attitudes in the future for windowing and shadowing, as the verge of artful arrangements to concentration has for centuries been a curious combination.\
